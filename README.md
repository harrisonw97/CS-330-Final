 How do I approach designing software?
        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
        
    This project has helped me plan ahead a lot more, thinking in visual space of how multiple objects will interact in a constantly developing project.
        
        What design process did you follow for your project work?
        
    I started with taking a photo of my scene then using graph paper to plot out where I roughly wanted my objects. I would try to start going shape by shape and then noticing any impacts a new object had on others in the way of size or placement. 
        
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
        
        I can definetly see me making my programs more forward compatible, not hard coding things but looking ahead and seeing how one part of the program might be used again.

How do I approach developing programs?

        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
      
     I found myself getting stuck at times then returning back to earlier stages of my program. This reinstilled the importance of moving slowly and going through multiple attampts. 
        
        How did iteration factor into your development?
        
    I had to run through adding shapes often, I would make progress and then use that stable place as a testing ground as I experimented with getting all my shapes to be where I wanted them
        
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
        
    I have had to keep my code more organized and formatted so that adding in new features did not make it impossible to edit and read my original code providing the foundation for the program

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
        
   computational graphics and visualizations has taught me a lot about how mathmatics and computerscience can be used to create remarkable creative projects, the skills i've gained from working with such complex tools will translate into the next situation where I have to tackle a difficult project.
        
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
        
    computational graphics and visualizations have given me the knowlidge of more specific C++ and C skills that will serve me well in debugging and managing multiple versions and work enviorments to create one centeralized project
